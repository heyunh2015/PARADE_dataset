code and dataset of EMNLP 2020 paper "PARADE: A New Dataset for Paraphrase Identification Requiring Computer Science Domain Knowledge"

Except the binary-labels-verion dicussed in the paper, we also release more fine-grained labels here:

3: 3 expert annotators label this pair as paraphrase

2: 2 expert annotators label this pair as paraphrase

1: 1 expert annotators label this pair as paraphrase

0: 0 expert annotators label this pair as paraphrase

And we evaluate Albert-xxlarge on this four-classes version dataset and obtain an accuracy of 0.512, which is more challenging than the binary-labels-verion dicussed in the paper.
